# Lovely Loveseats Receipt Generator

## Overview
As a beginner Python programmer, I have created a simple project to help automate the process of generating receipts for customers of my small furniture store, Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. This project utilizes basic Python programming concepts to store item descriptions, prices, calculate sales tax, and generate personalized receipts for customers.

## Features
- **Catalog Management**: I have defined variables to store descriptions and prices for the items available in my furniture store.
- **Customer Interaction**: I can easily add customers by initializing variables to store their total cost and itemization list.
- **Sales Tax Calculation**: The program calculates the sales tax based on a predefined tax rate and adds it to the customer's total cost.
- **Receipt Generation**: I can print out personalized receipts for each customer, including a list of purchased items and the total cost.

## Usage
To use this program:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Open the `scripy.py` file in your preferred Python editor or IDE.
3. Customize the item descriptions and prices in the catalog section according to your store's inventory.
4. Add new customers by initializing variables to store their total cost and itemization list, and adjust the items purchased accordingly.
5. Run the script to generate personalized receipts for your customers.
